# Predictive Model for Pitstop Strategy in Formula 1 using Ensemble Learning

### Abstract
This project looks into the application of advanced analytics and machine learning to optimize pit-stop strategy in Formula 1 racing. By analyzing historical data on tire degradation, weather conditions, and sensor data, an ensemble learning model is built to predict the optimal timing for pitstops and its impact on race outcomes.

### Introduction
Formula 1 racing strategies can significantly influence race outcomes. This research explores the construction of a predictive model to reimagine pit-stop strategies using data-driven insights, particularly focusing on the dynamic nature of the sport.

### EDA
Data was sourced from Tracing Insights and Pitwall, encompassing historical race data, trackside data, and driver positions. Data preparation included null value treatment, categorical to numerical transformations, and feature engineering.

### Model Building
An ensemble model using a stacking approach was developed, integrating a Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier with Logistic Regression as the meta-learner.

## Evaluation
The model's accuracy was assessed through performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for predicting both pitstops and driver positions.
